                <p>
                    It's been a long time coming, but after a sometimes seemingly endless wait, the 2015 NFL season has
                    finally begun. If
                    you were like me, your life finally had purpose again. Food once again had a taste, colors began to
                    shine more vividly, and your time spent on ESPN greatly increased.
                </p>

                <p>A lot had changed over the summer. Some big name free agents had swapped teams, namely running backs.
                    While there was little to no hype around the incoming RB class, the top 2 picks in the draft were
                    highly praised QB's (more on them later), and a WR class with increasingly high expectations after
                    the rookie breakouts from the 2014 season.</p>

                <p>Other intresting news included, the Jets were once again searching for a quarterback.</p>

                <p>The Tampa Bay Buccaneers finally saw their luck change, and were able to secure the #1 overall pick
                    in the draft. With a newly re-inspired fanbase, the organization saw this as a great opportunity to
                    rebrand themselves, and start anew by releasing a new team logo.</p>

                <img src="http://dailysnark.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/20611_801074563322260_3839580844381402958_n.jpg"
                     class="img-responsive center-block" alt="Preseason is over">
                <br>

                <p>However, with all the things that changing around the league, it was good to find some stability.
                    Something all fans could count on for the comming season; and that
                    was the consistency of Tim Tebow's 53-man roster
                    spot.</p>

                <br>

                <p>In fact, possibly the only bigger guarantee we know we can count on, is the fact that the NFL (as an
                    organization) is to be taken
                    seriously. Particularly when it comes to matters of personal conduct both on and off the field.
                    Players
                    have to remain in line, and represent the shield with pride. The NFL is increasingly staunch on this
                    position, and have a zero tolerance policy
                    against those who think otherwise. This
                    never has been more clear than perhaps this offseason, as we saw big name players, with heavy fines.
                    I think we can all agree, the severity of each was fair, and quite applicable to the crime.

                    especially in a contract year), however, Brady and the Patriots went quite an opposite route, and
                    that ended up being all that was talked about for nearly the entire summer.</p>

                <p>So, despite all the happenings this summer, those discussed above as well as;the entire 49ers defense
                    retiring, Mariota going #2 in the draft, etc.; the entire offseason was essentially consumed with
                    one topic...<strong>Deflategate</strong>. All of that ended when Judge Berman decided to throw out
                    the suspension on grounds of a lack of fair due process for Brady. This caused a very clear rift,
                    which forced all fans of football alike, to really look within themselves, and determine <em>"Where
                        do
                        I side on such an important, and sensitive issue as deflated balls."</em></p>

                <br>

                <p>With Brady once again free, Roger was left to contemplate and reflect on this entire circus show.
                    Again, he was once again reminded that
                    while being the most hated commisioner in professional sports, he is also a joke when it comes to
                    handing down punishments.</p>

                <br>

                <p>All that being said, that meant Brady was on the field for week 1, and it seemed clear, he had every
                    intention of rubbing that fact in Goodell's face</p>

                <p>The stage was set for Thursday night, Steelers vs. Patriots, a battle of offensive
                    juggernauts. The Steelers knew they were
                    going to have their work cut out for them on defense, but Mike Tomlin had come up with what seemed
                    to be a bulletproof strategy:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p><em>We're going to leave Gronk wide open the entire game, and force him to beat us. We don't
                        even think Brady will see him out there.</em></p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>Some critics who aren't as in tune with the chess match that is professional football, questioned the
                    tactics.</p>

                <img src="http://i0.wp.com/thirteen05.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/post-28652-thats-a-bold-strategy-cotton-g-g2uB.gif"
                     class="img-responsive center-block"
                     alt="Bold Move">
                <br>

                <p>We all know though, that the proof is in the pudding. Surely, the critics would be silenced as the
                    Steelers boarded their bus home Thursday night, with a victory in hand, and a particularly sly grin
                    across Tomlin's face.</p>

                <p>The game started, and true to his word, Tomlin deployed the questionable tactic several times
                    throughout the course of the game. Each time, with equaled success.</p>

                <br>

                <p>Much to the surprise of experts everywhere, the tactic did not pay off. The issue seemed to be two
                    fold.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Through some form of witchcraft and wizardry, Brady was in fact able to locate Gronk on the
                        field.
                    </li>
                    <li>The Steelers had mistakenly put in the highschool sub package, resulting in Gronk being roughly
                        2 feet taller than the tallest defender.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>He was truly a man amongst boys, and all told, it amounted to an impressive start to the season for
                    Gronkowski

                    debut, Rogers spent every spare moment he wasn't throwing a touchdown, to ensure he could get any
                    competitive advantage possible.</p>

                    Both QB's started out very strong. Marcus kicked things off by

                <p>Marcus would end up sitting out the majority of the second half, as he steamrolled his way to an
                    impressive victory, and notched the second highest fantasy point total of the week, just behind Tom

                <p>In addition to watching Mariota tear up the Bucs, all the Oregon fans out there will likely have fond
                    memories of watching Chip and the Ducks over the
                    years, with
                    their creative playcards each week, and small army of play callers on the sideline. With the
                    effectiveness of this system at Oregon, it was no real surprise he continued to employ the same
                    system
                    when he brought the blur to the NFL.</p>

                <p>While most consider his system quite ingenious (ESPN even took at shot at trying to crack it
                    back in 2011):</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>
                        ESPN tapped Mark Kozek, a math professor at Whittier College in California and code-cracking
                        buff who used to play football, along with a team of photographers who kept their lenses trained
                        on Oregon's sideline for two road games, in an attempt to unravel Kelly's code before the Ducks'
                        2011 BCS national championship game against Auburn.

                <p>Despite the creativity and imagination, it still requires proper execution by the players on the
                    field. And as such, not every play can be guaranteed to work perfectly. Unfortunately for him, the
                    blowjob monkey, ultimately was one of those plays.</p>

                <p>Kiko Alonso made his Eagles debut in the same game, and attempted to do his best ODB impression, he
                    used a
                    couple extra fingers, but seeing as he wasn't the targeted receiver, I think we can let it
                    slide.</p>

                <p>Part of the reason I believe the 49ers weren't too worried about losing half of their starting
                    defense this offseason, is because of their stable of undercover players, who lie in the
                    weeds, waiting to be triggered into action at a moments notice.</p>

                <p>I think everyone was excited to see AP come back, unfortunately he had a very lackluster return. As
                    Skyler put it:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>Alot of things have changed this year, but the vikings still suck.</p>
                </blockquote>


                <p>Some jokes will just never die (and for good reason). DIgging back into the archives, I found some
                    very early footage of a young Mark Sanchez honing his craft in the backyard with his father. Though
                    he may be older now, you will notice a very similar technique/playstyle to what we've been
                    accustomed to seeing in the NFL of late.</p>

                <h3>Fantasy Recap</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>It was already noted that the TuribleBurittos made a bad call, and despite their better judgement,
                    left James Jones <span data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="right" title="No Data"

                                           data-html="true" pid="10522"><img class="news"
                                                                             src="img/news_breaking.png"></span> on
                    the bench for what turned out to be a very solid fantasy outting at
                    <strong>17</strong>
                    points. Good enough for the 4th best performance at the WR position last week. However it had no
                    bearing on the game, as the Stud Muffins shit the bed pretty hard (and by s.t.b. I mean, would have
                    beaten 6 other teams in the league this week with their point total).
                </p>
                <p>The teams that were meant to win really did this week. In fact, there was only one team that lost,
                    had enough points on their bench, that had they made the right calls, could have changed a loss into
                    a victory. That would be the Moon Bears, who scooped up a fat goosegg from DeSean Jackson, and a
                    mere 5 points from Forsett, while 19 points lingered on his bench in Sproles and Garcon. In turn
                    however, Fatty Albert could have swapped in Bishop Sankey who scored 20 points...wait, wow, that's
                    correct, 20 points! So either way it didn't matter much for him.</p>

                <p>Speaking of how odd this week was, TE's went absolutely bananas:</p>

                <br>
                <p>By contrast, only <strong>two WR's broke 20+ points</strong> last week.</p>
                <p>You could argue that with the exception of Aaron Rodgers, not another single 1st round draft pick really gave a good return on investment as he was the only one to finish in the top 12 players in scoring last week.  Of all the 1st rounders, AP fared only slightly better than Le'Veon Bell, who didn't even play.  For a comparison, he scored as many points as the Jaguars Defense...</p>

                <p>The most pathetic showing of the week...by far...was the matchup of Fat Albert v. Moon Bears.  Combined, they scored 123 points, which means, Where Who could have beaten their combined score, single handedly.</p>

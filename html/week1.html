                <p>
                    It's been a long time coming, but after a tumultuous wait, the 2015 NFL season has finally begun. If
                    you were like me, your life finally had purpose again.
                </p>

                <p>A lot had changed over the summer. Some big name free agents had swapped teams, namely running backs.
                    While there was little to no hype around the incoming RB class, the top 2 picks in the draft were
                    highly praised QB's (more on them later), and a WR class with increasingly high expectations after
                    the rookie breakouts from the 2014 season. The Jets were once again searchign for a quarterback</p>

                <br>

                <p>The once hottest name in the NFL was learning how to take a back seat to...err...Kirk Cousins?</p>

                <p>Which just further cements why Skip Bayless is an idiot, and no one will be calling for him to be a
                    GM anytime soon.

                <p>Just about the only thing that didn't change, was the consistency of Tim Tebow's 53-man roster
                    spot.</p>

                <p>In fact, possibly the only bigger garauntee we know to be true, is that the NFL is to be taken
                    seriously. Particularly when it comes to personal conduct both on and off the field. Players
                    have to remain in line, and represent the shield with pride, and there is a zero tolerance policy
                    against those who think otherwise. This
                    never has been more clear than perhaps this offseason, as we saw big name players, with heavy fines
                    (additionally, see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dont%C3%A9_Stallworth">Stallworth,
                        Donte</a>, who apparently works for the <a

                        Post</a> now).</p>

                <br>

                <p>Hardy, would choose not to appeal his suspension (chances of injury are much less on vacation,
                    especially in a contract year), however, Brady and the Patriots went quite an opposite route, and
                    that ended up being all that was talked about for nearly the entire summer.</p>

                <>Despite all the happenings this summer; big free-agents changing squads, the entire 49ers defense
                retiring, Mariota going #2 in the draft, etc.; the entire offseason was essentially consumed with
                one topic...<strong>Deflategate</strong>. All of that ended when Judge Berman decided to throw out
                the suspension on grounds of a lack of fair due process for Brady. This caused a very clear rift,
                which forced all fans of football alike, to really look within themselves, and determine where to
                side on such an issue.</p>

                <br>

                <p>Roger meanwhile, was once again reminded that
                    while being the most hated commisioner in professional sports, he is also a joke when it comes to
                    handing down punishments. He also considers himself an impartial 3rd party, which he's still trying
                    to understand.</p>

                     alt="Three types of people">
                <br>

                <p>All that being said, that meant Brady was on the field for week 1, and it seemed clear, he had every
                    intention of rubbing that fact in Goodell's face</p>

                <p>The stage was set for Thursday night, Steelers vs. Patriots, a battle of offensive
                    juggernauts. The Steelers knew they were
                    going to have their work cut out for them on defense, but Mike Tomlin had come up with what seemed
                    to be a bulletproof strategy:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p><em>We're going to leave Gronk wide open the entire game, and make force him to beat us. We don't
                        even think Brady will see him out there.</em></p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>Some critics who aren't as intune with the chessmatch that is football, questioned the tactics</p>

                <img src="http://i0.wp.com/thirteen05.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/post-28652-thats-a-bold-strategy-cotton-g-g2uB.gif"
                     class="img-responsive center-block"
                     alt="Bold Move">
                <br>

                <p>We all know though, that the proof is in the pudding. Surely, the critics would be silenced as the
                    Steelers boarded their bus home Thursday night, with a victory in hand.</p>

                <p>The game started, and true to his word, Tomlin deployed the questionable tactic several times
                    throughout the course of the game. Each time, with equaled success.</p>

                <br>

                <p>Much to the surprise of experts everywhere, the tactic did not pay off. The issue seemed to be two
                    fold.
                <ol>
                    <li>Brady was in fact able to locate Gronk on the field.</li>
                    <li>The Steelers had mistakenly put in the highschool sub package, resulting in Gronk being roughly
                        2 feet taller than the tallest defender.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                He was truly a man amongst boys, and all told, it amounted to an impressive start to the season:
                <strong>5 Receptions/94 Yards/3 TDs</strong>, for a whopping <strong>27</strong> fantasy points.
                </p>
                <p>The Steelers made the game look close on a late TD pass to Antonio Brown (which apparently had a <a
                        href="http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/eye-on-football/25298375/antonio-browns-last-second-td-vs-pats-had-a-100m-gambling-impact">$100
                    Million gambling impact</a>, but make no mistake, had there been more than 1 second left on the
                    clock, Gronk would have likely ended the night with 4 TD's.</p>

                <p>The only other real take away from that game, was the fact that Antonio Brown looks like a LEGO
                    character</p>

                <p>How great was it to wake up Sunday morning, and know there was a full slate of NFL games to watch.
                    The first week to see your team in action. The ups, the downs, the roller coaster that is fantasy
                    football. The misery, the jubilation, the down right awesomeness. A full day jam packed from sunup
                    to sundown of fantasy glory.</p>

                <p>Among a few of the notable moments. Aaron Rodgers reunited with James Jones, seemingly forgot that
                    he'd lost Jordy Nelson for the season. While Jones rode the bench to an impressive 2 TD day in his
                    debut, Rogers spent every spare moment he wasn't throwing a touchdown, to ensure he could get any
                    competitive advantage possible.</p>

                <br>


                <p>For many of us, though we care little for the Titans or Bucs, we did want to see Mariota succeed, and
                    in particular, against Winston. Both QB's started out very strong. Marcus kicked things off by
                    throwing his first NFL TD pass to Kendall Wright for a Titans touchdown. Not to be outdone, on the
                    subsequent drive, Winston followed suit with the same.</p>

                </div>
                <p>Marcus would end up sitting out the majority of the second half, as he steamrolled his way to an
                    impressive victory, and notched the second highest fantasy point total of the week, just behind Tom
                    Brady with <strong>32</strong> and <strong>35</strong> points respectfully.</p>

                <p>All the Oregon fans out there will likely have fond memories of watching Chip and the Ducks over the
                    years, with
                    their creative playcards each week, and small army of play callers on the sideline. With the
                    effectiveness of this system at Oregon, it was no real surprise he continued to employ the same
                    system
                    when he brought the blur to the NFL.</p>

                <p>While most would consider his system quite ingenious, ESPN even took at shot at trying to crack it
                    back in 2011:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>
                        ESPN tapped Mark Kozek, a math professor at Whittier College in California and code-cracking
                        buff who used to play football, along with a team of photographers who kept their lenses trained
                        on Oregon's sideline for two road games, in an attempt to unravel Kelly's code before the Ducks'
                        2011 BCS national championship game against Auburn.

                <p>Unfortunately for him, the blowjob monkey, ultimately was unable to
